# TURN REST API flag.
# (Time Limited Long Term Credential)
# Flag that sets a special authorization option that is based upon authentication secret.
#
# This feature's purpose is to support "TURN Server REST API", see
# "TURN REST API" link in the project's page
# https://github.com/coturn/coturn/
#
# This option is used with timestamp:
#
# usercombo -> "timestamp:userid"
# turn user -> usercombo
# turn password -> base64(hmac(secret key, usercombo))
#
# This allows TURN credentials to be accounted for a specific user id.
# If you don't have a suitable id, then the timestamp alone can be used.
# This option is enabled by turning on secret-based authentication.
# The actual value of the secret is defined either by the option static-auth-secret,
# or can be found in the turn_secret table in the database (see below).
#
# Read more about it:
#  - https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-uberti-behave-turn-rest-00
#  - https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/87/slides/slides-87-behave-10.pdf
#
# Be aware that use-auth-secret overrides some parts of lt-cred-mech.
# The use-auth-secret feature depends internally on lt-cred-mech, so if you set
# this option then it automatically enables lt-cred-mech internally
# as if you had enabled both.
#
# Note that you can use only one auth mechanism at the same time! This is because,
# both mechanisms conduct username and password validation in different ways.
#
# Use either lt-cred-mech or use-auth-secret in the conf
# to avoid any confusion.
#
use-auth-secret

# 'Static' authentication secret value (a string) for TURN REST API only.
# If not set, then the turn server
# will try to use the 'dynamic' value in the turn_secret table
# in the user database (if present). The database-stored  value can be changed on-the-fly
# by a separate program, so this is why that mode is considered 'dynamic'.

static-auth-secret=${COTURN_SECRET_KEY}

# The default realm to be used for the users when no explicit
# origin/realm relationship is found in the database, or if the TURN
# server is not using any database (just the commands-line settings
# and the userdb file). Must be used with long-term credentials
# mechanism or with TURN REST API.
#
# Note: If the default realm is not specified, then realm falls back to the host domain name.
#       If the domain name string is empty, or set to '(None)', then it is initialized as an empty string.

# Uncomment to set the lifetime for the channel.
# Default value is 600 secs (10 minutes).
# This value MUST not be changed for production purposes.

#channel-lifetime=600

# Option to set the log file name.
# By default, the turnserver tries to open a log file in
# /var/log, /var/tmp, /tmp and the current directory
# (Whichever file open operation succeeds first will be used).
# With this option you can set the definite log file name.
# The special names are "stdout" and "-" - they will force everything
# to the stdout. Also, the "syslog" name will force everything to
# the system log (syslog).
# In the runtime, the logfile can be reset with the SIGHUP signal
# to the turnserver process.

#log-file=/var/tmp/turn.log

# Option to hide software version. Enhance security when used in production.
# Revealing the specific software version of the agent through the
# SOFTWARE attribute might allow them to become more vulnerable to
# attacks against software that is known to contain security holes.
# Implementers SHOULD make usage of the SOFTWARE attribute a
# configurable option (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5389#section-16.1.2)
